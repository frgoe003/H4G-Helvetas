# Hack4Good Project: Satellite Imagery Analysis - Impact Measurement of Trail Bridges in Nepal

## Introduction
Welcome to our Hack4Good project focused on measuring the impact of trail bridges in Nepal using satellite imagery analysis. This project was part of the Fall 2022 Hack4Good initiative and was undertaken by a team from ETH Zurich in collaboration with Helvetas.

## Abstract
Helvetas, a Non-governmental organization, has been actively involved in improving rural access in Nepal, including the construction of trail bridges. This project aims to measure the impact of these trail bridges, particularly focusing on changes in settlement patterns, using satellite imagery analysis. Through the Hack4Good initiative, we explore the potential of satellite imagery in large-scale impact measurement and aim to validate the positive results attributed to these infrastructures.

## Approach
Our approach involves using satellite data as predictor data, with the location of the bridges in Nepal serving as points of interest. We focused on bridges built in 2019 and conducted a temporal analysis for seven years (three years before and three years after construction). The key steps of our approach include:

1. **Bridge Data Collection:** Gathering information about bridges built in Nepal, including geographic coordinates and construction years.
2. **Predictor Data:** Utilizing publicly available optical satellite imagery, particularly Sentinel-2, and Dynamic World (DW) land use classification map derived from Sentinel-2 products.
3. **Data Processing:** Employing Google Earth Engine (GEE) for computationally intensive data querying and processing.
4. **Metric Calculation:** Defining metrics to quantify the positive change brought by these bridges, such as the growth rate of built-up areas before and after bridge construction.

## Results
Our analysis revealed interesting insights into the impact of trail bridges on settlement patterns in Nepal. We observed variations in the growth rates of built areas around bridges, with some bridges leading to an increase while others showed a decrease. Correlation analysis indicated a potential relationship between bridge impact and elevation, suggesting the need for further investigation.

## Limitations & Outlook
While our project achieved significant insights, there are limitations and opportunities for future exploration:
- **Crop Analysis:** Further analysis based on crops could provide additional insights into impact measurement.
- **Data Accuracy:** Double-checking construction years of bridges can enhance the accuracy of analysis.
- **Visualization Tools:** Developing online dashboards or web applications can facilitate visualization and interpretation of land use changes.

## Conclusion
Our Hack4Good project showcased the potential of satellite imagery analysis in measuring the impact of trail bridges in Nepal. By leveraging advanced technologies and interdisciplinary collaboration, we aim to contribute to evidence-based decision-making and sustainable development initiatives.
